# casper-scripts
General scripts for Self Service policies and other parts of the Casper Suite.

RE: symantec_postinstall.sh, use the script as a postinstall within Composer for a pkg that puts SymantecRemovalTool.command in /private/tmp/, then deploy via policy (Self Service on-demand recommended).
